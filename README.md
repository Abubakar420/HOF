# Interia


Check the preview of the webite - [Interia](https://meet244.github.io/Interia/)

This is very interesting and very first project using html, css and js.<br />

All the code is completely written by me and my first ever html project.<br />

Images and assets are stored in folder - source.<br />

The design is inspired from [Livespace](https://www.livspace.com/in)<br />

I have designed this website only for the laptop view, it dose'nt support mobile and other devices. 

Enjoy this!
